I tagged [version 0.0.2 of Marmerine](https://github.com/josephscott/marmerine/releases/tag/0.0.2) this week.  This version adds support for the following Memcached commands:

- version
- replace
- append
- prepend
- touch
- incr
- decr

Some of the features in the next version will require data schema changes, so I wanted to get this set of changes out the door.
